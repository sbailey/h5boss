To build the documentation for your python code, e.g., h5boss:

1. Install python packages: Sphinx, numpydoc

2. Follow Sphinx's tutorial and run a quickstart

To edit and publish your website locally

1. Edit web page file in source/
   e.g., install.rst

2. Export Sphinx's binary to $PATH
   e.g., export PATH=$PATH:/somepath/Sphinx/bin
 
3. Export sphinx and numpydoc's libraries in $PYTHONPATH
   e.g., export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/somepath/Sphinx/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/:/somepath/numpydoc/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

4. run `make html` at the same level of source/

5. launch website locally: open build/index.rst in any browser
